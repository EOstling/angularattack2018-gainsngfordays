# angularattack2018-gainsngfordays

The app is a Cross Fit gym application. The app will display a gyms WODs (Workout of the Day) and allow a member to track 
their individual status on different exercises.

The app was built by Brian Jones, Eliot Ostling and Kennon Bowie for the 2018 Angular Attack. Brian and Kennon had no experience
before this event.

The application will display the daily workouts, and through the WOD Admin feature you can create a new workout (though not persited).

A user can track their work in each movement/execrise. Long term this information will be shown on a graph.

Thanks for the experience and all the fish.

Brian, Eliot and Kennon
